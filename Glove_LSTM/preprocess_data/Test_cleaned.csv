1,this be easily one of the good movie of the 1950s Otto Preminger direct only four or five really good movie and this be one of -PRON- Frank Sinatra give -PRON- good performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein be dynamite from the open title by Saul Bass to the hysteria of drug addict Frank go cold turkey this be a riveting movie with Kim Novak give a very good performance Eleanor Parker give a very bad performance as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank 's grift pal Beware of bad print this movie be in the public domain so some copy be pretty rough
0,-PRON- may not be a critic but here be what -PRON- think of this movie well just watch the movie on cinemax and first of all -PRON- just have to say how much -PRON- hate the storyline -PRON- mean come on what do a snowman scare besides little kid secondly -PRON- be pretty gory but -PRON- bet since the movie be so low budget -PRON- probably use ketchup so my critical vote be BOMB nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
1,in Joel Schumacher -PRON- have one of the most inconsistent film maker of all time but this be common knowledge -PRON- think -PRON- main problem be the array of genre that -PRON- cover whilst at the same time fail to develop any sort of certain style that may label -PRON- an auteur hitchcock like -PRON- suspense and -PRON- horrorthriller Chaplin like -PRON- comedy Scorsese like -PRON- crime drive mafia story amongst other and Spielberg like -PRON- large scale big budget adventure film that combine just enough violence for the adult and fun for the kid other more obscure example include Kubrick and Welles who cover too much to write about herebr br but Schumacher be the sort of guy who make a flawed film revolve around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolve around a seemingly dull premise fall down have a great idea behind -PRON- but -PRON- find -PRON- flawed and anticlimactic with too many scene seemingly rely on comedy Batman be a superhero superhero film have be big hit recently so how -PRON- manage to make not one but two appalling superhero film be beyond -PRON- then come 8mm a film with a basic premise that be execute in an impressive manner before Tigerland which be Schumacher 's good film from what -PRON- have so far see in -PRON- opinion with the war genre laughter be not something -PRON- 'd associate with -PRON- for most of the time -PRON- can remember scoff at the absurdity of the DDay landing during Saving Private Ryan at the time when -PRON- first see the film -PRON- have not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when -PRON- begin and finish -PRON- eyebrow be up -PRON- mouth slightly open with a weak ' -PRON- can not believe -PRON- smile ' on -PRON- face needless to say -PRON- be because of that film -PRON- search out learn a bit more on what that event be all about and the war as a whole in Tigerland -PRON- be invite to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz Farrell a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam Warbr br but what be clever here be that there be no jaw drop war scene of fighting and death and destruction just one man and -PRON- battle with the system for most of the time the thing -PRON- say and the audacity at which -PRON- deal with -PRON- predicament be reminiscent of a school child wind up a series of teacher at an extremely strict boarding school Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense -PRON- be a training routine for the Vietnam War but ego and superego play more of a part here -PRON- think the superego that be the drill sergeant go up against Bozz whose ego be extremely large there be also the third part of Freud 's triangle that sneak into Bozz the ID compare to all the other soldier who all have rather large ego Bozz be the only one brave enough to show -PRON- in front of the sergeant thus suggest -PRON- be allow what -PRON- should not do to float to the surface and express -PRON- -PRON- be all dead in this situation bark a sergeant Any Questions yeah if -PRON- be dead how come -PRON- can ask a question reply Bozz whose punishment such as pushup and dirt eat seem to unfaze -PRON- in true ID style that be -PRON- enjoy the punishmentsbr br also regard the superego Bozz at one point try to command a group of soldier in field training this be something the exist captain of the squad can not do thus suggest -PRON- be lack in both the superego require for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz -PRON- be in charge what follow be an actual conversation between Bozz and an exist drill sergeant who give -PRON- -PRON- christian name this be where Private Wilson 's Whigham character step in -PRON- uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explode at certain time all culminate in the film 's only real scene of a shootout which be in the form of a training exercise in a river Wilson can not control -PRON- impulse and dislike toward Bozz and act outbr br what -PRON- also like about Tigerland be that -PRON- be shoot in such a way that be brave while lack in innovation Tigerland seem to use low grade film stock or less camera to get across -PRON- gritty look make no mistake that this could have be a pretty looking film with lot of colour and attractiveness but -PRON- get a documentary approach in the final piece make everything look like -PRON- be shoot on a typical everyday camera for tv the emphasis on the hand hold be also apparent but Schumacher be clever -PRON- never allow the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggest the film 's budget could have be half of what -PRON- be -PRON- be worth say here that Spielberg say -PRON- want Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those line and as if -PRON- be record from the war scenesbr br while be very funny and entertaining Tigerland be still a great study of what make people tick not necessarily in war but in the close possible substitute -PRON- study on one man and how much -PRON- hate the system that -PRON- can not even take -PRON- seriously be fascinating as be the drive of each soldier there be several memorable scene and situation culminate in a happy if not unhappy end that will open -PRON- mind and make -PRON- think about what -PRON- be perhaps really like in the military

0,-PRON- watch the 219 minute version and have to say that dollarfordollar -PRON- -PRON- probably one of the bad film ever now -PRON- be not say -PRON- be the bad film everbut if -PRON- look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy -PRON- this be a very very bad filmbr br -PRON- would say that the single big factor make this a bad film be the writerdirector Michael Cimino rarely can so much blame be place on a single person have -PRON- not be so selfindulgent a film just as bad could have easily be make at about 90 minutessave the studio million br br the film begin with a completely unnecessary prologue that be suppose to be set at Harvard the scene be HUGE but completely without context -PRON- have no idea exactly what be occur nor do -PRON- know why the student in particular John Hurt be behave so boorishly -PRON- find -PRON- very hard to imagine a commencement go like this in 1870and -PRON- look a lot more like 1970 this be a half hour where -PRON- have no idea what be happen who the character be or -PRON- motivation br br the next scene be 20 year later inexplicably the two Harvard grad Hurt and Kris Kristofferson be in Wyoming so -PRON- go to the good school in America and now one be only a law man in the middle of no where and the other iswell what be John Hurt in the film -PRON- just appear here and there and seem to be either a jerk the prologue or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hang out with murdererseven though -PRON- be apparently against -PRON- -PRON- entire character make no sense -PRON- never explain why -PRON- be a Brit live in the middle of nowhere -PRON- be impossible to hide -PRON- accent why -PRON- bother to come along with the hire army if -PRON- be so against -PRON- wicked plan nor why -PRON- would risk -PRON- life for a cause -PRON- do not believe in at all as for Kristofferson -PRON- excellent acting and well define character make -PRON- character more believable though have -PRON- move to Wyoming and risk -PRON- life for a prostitute make no sense at allbr br this bring up the bad aspect of HEAVEN 'S GATE while the scene be WAY too long and need trim the bad part of the film be that the character be like cardboard John Hurt a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film Jeff Bridges and many other big name be there but -PRON- have no idea why in fact other than Kristofferson Isabelle Huppert as a hooker with a heart of goldquite the cliché and perhaps Christopher Walken EVERYONE be completely onedimensional -PRON- be hard to imagine a movie this long where -PRON- do not know or understand the character br br much of the film also seem anachronistic who would have think to have a giant roller rink construct in the middle of no where in 1890 -PRON- be sure that just get the basic supply in this region in the West would have be very very difficultand yet -PRON- be expect to believe that train fill with roller skate and lumber arrive instead of food maybe if -PRON- have not spend a bazillion dollar build and frequent the roller rink the farmer could have afford to buy food and avoid this war over purloin cattle and what be with the guy on roller skate with the fiddle what do this have to do with a land war br br the most obvious problem -PRON- be leave with be that -PRON- be a film where very very little actually happen until the big battle late in the film there be lot of scene of filth and flat nothingness so much nothingness that by the time the battle occur many audience member would have leave or be now so hostile to the film that -PRON- be inevitable that nothing could salvage the filmbr br as for the final battle -PRON- be do reasonably well but have problem first this minor skirmish on the prairie last long than the DDay invasion second while detail of the actual event of the socalled Johnson County War be a tad sketchy -PRON- do know that the character play by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually be there as -PRON- 'd both be hang before the battle third -PRON- can not believe that Cimino actually kill animal throughout the filmespecially during the final battle while -PRON- be far from a bleed heart about animal right -PRON- need to use animal gut and actually kill some of the horse be a low point in cinematic history watch and know that some of the horse die to achieve Cimino 's vision for the film be very sadbr br finally after the big battle -PRON- have an epilogue while -PRON- be blessedly short -PRON- also seem completely unnecessary and vague -PRON- see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht so -PRON- can assume that -PRON- be finally put some of that Harvard education to work for -PRON- -PRON- also see a woman who appear to be one that Kris look at a couple time during the prologue most importantly nothing be say and -PRON- have no idea what the final outcome -PRON- read up on -PRON- -PRON- and find that the film often get the fact wrongbr br overall to say the film be long and need ton more editing be like say WWII be a minor tiff well -PRON- have certainly see a lot bad but if -PRON- factor in the cost of production -PRON- truly think -PRON- may just be one of the bad film in historybr br finally when a film have this much explicit nudity -PRON- warn parent however as no child COULD sit through this film even with a promise of sex the warning be not necessary

1,-PRON- do not need to read this reviewbr br an early review by pninson of Seattle have already identify all the main shortcoming of this production -PRON- can only amplify -PRON- basic argumentsbr br Bleak House be a relatively late Dickens novel and be much dark than -PRON- early work this be take too literally by the director Ross Devenish who pile on the gloom and fog too much when Ada Rick and Esther appear half an hour into the opening episode -PRON- be a relief just to be in daylight for the first time in some of the murky scene -PRON- be hard to see what be actually on -PRON- tv screen -PRON- watch the whole thing in one day start in midafternoon as daylight fade this become less of an issue but -PRON- have a pretty good tv and -PRON- have never encounter this problem before at any time of daybr br the pacing be very deliberate ie slow -PRON- be sure this be intensional but -PRON- be overdone there be numerous shot of people trudge though the muck and gloom of victorian London that be hold long than be necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere a good editor could probably take several minute out of each fiftyminute episode without lose a line of dialogue just by trim each of these scene slightlybr br -PRON- do not want to overstate these two problem -PRON- soon adjust to the look and pace of this production the more important issue be that -PRON- do not always tell the story very effectively early Dickens novel be as long as bleak House but be not nearly so intricately plot for example -PRON- recently reread Nicholas Nickleby because -PRON- be intrigue to see how Douglas McGrath cram an 800 page book into -PRON- twohour movie the answer be simple the book be full of pad McGrath cut great swathe of the novel while still retain all the essential story element this would not be possible with Bleak House br br this production need -PRON- seven hour probably -PRON- need even long because many element of -PRON- convoluted plot be not sufficiently clear or as well handle as -PRON- need to be a few random example will illustrate the problemsbr br the maid Rosa appear from nowhere with no background so Lady Dedlock 's attachment to -PRON- be largely unmotivatedbr br Sergeant George 's acquiescence in Tulkinhorn 's demand for a sample of Horton 's handwriting be somewhat fudgedbr br -PRON- be not make clear enough that Esther be actually in love with Woodcourt when -PRON- agree to marry John Jarndyce neither be -PRON- clear that -PRON- have agree not to announce -PRON- engagement or whybr br Ada and Rick 's secret marriage be omit in one episode -PRON- be merely lover in the next people be suddenly refer to -PRON- as husband and wifebr br Mrs Rouncewell be only introduce at a late stage in the story and Sargeant George 's estrangement from -PRON- family be leave unexplained   as be the mean by which -PRON- be discoveredbr br Tulkinhorn 's dedication to maintain the honour and respectability of the Dedlock family be understate so -PRON- motive for persecute Lady Dedlock be more obscure than -PRON- need bebr br the involvement of the brick maker with both Tom and later Lady Dedlock be somewhat opaquebr br -PRON- be not obvious that Guppy renew -PRON- offer to Esther because -PRON- smallpox scar have all but vanishedbr br this be only a selection there be other -PRON- be not major problem and the main thrust of the story be clear enough nonetheless -PRON- be minor irritation that detract from -PRON- power -PRON- should not have to puzzle over little plot point however there be more important structural problem that do weaken the story in -PRON- later stagesbr br the whole business of Tulkinhorn 's murder be somewhat throw away Bucket immediately pinpoint Hortense as a suspect which undermine the suspense of Sergeant George 's predicament and the importance of find Mrs Rouncewell -PRON- also diminish the impact of the subplot in which suspicion be throw on Lady Dedlock and weaken the scene in which Hortense be unmasked in front of Sir Lesterbr br a more serious problem be that the murder -PRON- investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate the story for over an hour during which time -PRON- completely lose sight of the other main plot strand the legal case and -PRON- effect on Rick -PRON- failing finance -PRON- gouging by Vholes and Skimpole Ada 's despair -PRON- decline health and so on be all put on hold for an entire episode this may be how Dickens write the book -PRON- have not read -PRON- for year but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strand move forward togetherbr br finally Smallweed 's role in the story be so diminished that -PRON- be almost superfluous -PRON- discovery of the new will that trigger the final phase of the story be also throw away -PRON- happen off screenbr br despite all of this -PRON- be still a very good production many of the performance be outstanding individual scene be beautifully realise -PRON- accumulate sense of tragedy be very powerful -PRON- would still be recommend -PRON- as a superb adaptation of a great book have -PRON- not be for the 2005 production in fact -PRON- probably would not be fully aware of -PRON- defect if -PRON- have not see how Andrew Davies do -PRON- well -PRON- have be critical of davy 's Jane Austen adaptation but -PRON- have to admit that -PRON- really know how to tame Dickens 's sprawl booksbr br this be an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hour of anybody 's time nonetheless -PRON- probable fate be to be view mainly as a crossreference to the neardefinitive 2005 version
1,which do -PRON- think the average person would know moreless about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi 's late film entitle ' Offside ' a tale that use football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scene revolve around one 's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual 's right to extend that courtesy if and when -PRON- 'd like to the odd thing be -PRON- do not come away from offside have learn about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless -PRON- be an education in Panahi 's controversial style but -PRON- do come away feel enlighten that at least someone from Iran have take a controversial issue that be clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran and be willing to present -PRON- to an international audience rather than exploit itbr br -PRON- can remember the 2006 World Cup -PRON- be sure many people can -PRON- be the summer after -PRON- initial year out at university and after the slog that be -PRON- first year a summer of World Cup football act as a nicely time tonic Needless to say -PRON- see practically every game bar the one -PRON- show simultaneously with the other one at the very end of the group stage so that to avoid incidence as see in Spain ' 82 when -PRON- be think West Germany and Austria transpire to get a result between -PRON- that would see -PRON- both through at the expense of Algeriabr br anyone in Britain that be watch the BBC 's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game both nation ' first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the BBC 's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match -PRON- go something like ' -PRON- have see giant Germany England Argentina and Holland play but now -PRON- get to seemexico and Iran battle -PRON- out ' the emphasis on the latter two be inferior be clear and that maybe watch -PRON- be a chore -PRON- be a shame because there be people and film like Offside present -PRON- who be really willing to see Iran play to the point where -PRON- risk -PRON- wellbeing to achieve -PRON- and -PRON- be sad when people in a position of power dismiss what -PRON- deem ' inferior ' when there be other who 'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engagebr br when immediately think of the word ' Iran ' ' football ' and ' World Cup ' -PRON- mind fly back to the France ' 98 game between say nation and America here be a film about a World Cup game of sort involve Iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmaker may well have opt to present a tale revolve around Iran 's famous victory over the United States and what that mean to -PRON- director Panahi choose to look at what go on behind the scene and present a story from the stand as woman be bar from football match and be not allow to live the ecstasy of win a game of immense magnitude -PRON- can imagine a heavy handed film detail Iran 's ' victory ' as a lumber propaganda film design to exploit as -PRON- ' defeat ' a western power or ' enemy ' at a sport -PRON- perhaps be not expect to do so inbr br a couple of film that spring to mind when -PRON- come to beat the unbeatable at -PRON- own game be 2001 indian film ' Lagaan ' in which the indian peasant defeat the rule british at cricket Similalry 2005 be ' the Game of -PRON- life ' see the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup the difference between these film and Offside be immense offside be look at a situation behind a state 's mentality and dare to explore an essence of Feminism as the girl try to see -PRON- beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup be round up like animal and keep in a crude purgatory mere foot from a bar window that would allow -PRON- to see the game the reasoning be to do with the foul language the man ' may ' not will but ' may ' use during the game the film present Iran as so incompetent that -PRON- can not take away a man 's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman 's right to see the game all together  -PRON- be no wonder Panahi 's film be -PRON- ban in Iranbr br but Panahi remember to include what make the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allow -PRON- female character to both smoke cigarette and use mobile phone two thing the doctor and scientist will have -PRON- think be far more dangerous to the human bodymind than hear a little bit of foul language at a football match Panahi pay special attention to the title of -PRON- film ' offside ' which -PRON- be a ruling within football detail when an ' attacker ' be ' catch ' try to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallel run with the women ' position in the film as these advance supposedly without right individual be catch try to put one over the opposition team that be the state itselfbr br -PRON- think offside be one of the well film to come out of the Middle East and surround Gulf area that -PRON- have see -PRON- be a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any act history accord to the IMDb and thus the acting be raw and real add

0,-PRON- have not read a time to kill by John Grisham and perhaps that would have help understand the film well but perhaps not -PRON- hear this be the most faithful Grisham adaption yet and if that be true -PRON- can see why so many publisher turn down the novel when Grisham introduce -PRON- as -PRON- first workbr br a time to Kill be one of those film that be seriously confused and want to do too many thing at once -PRON- want to be a suspenseful crowdplease thriller and at the same time a film dedicate to explore certain social and moral question let -PRON- face -PRON- those two type of film do not go together in Hollywood which be why Dead Man walk have to be make independentlybr br the story involve a young lawyer name Jake Matthew McConaughy out to defend a black man name Carl Samuel L Jackson from murder two hillbilly that brutally rape -PRON- young daughter the day before the rapist ' trial Carl hide in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapist be bring through the building -PRON- charge out and shoot both of -PRON- dead to help out with the defense Jack accept the help of a former law student Sandra Bullock who prove that -PRON- role in this film be totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposesbr br meanwhile one of the rapist 's kid brother Kiefer Sutherland be anger that a black man kill -PRON- brother and decide to act out a revenge all of this lead to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot -PRON- will admit that all of this hold -PRON- attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scene what -PRON- later object to be the film 's handling of ethical question and -PRON- use of formula in the plotbr br the main question that the film constantly ask over and over again be whether a black man get a fair trial from a white jury sure -PRON- can but that do not mean that the man have to be acquit in order for the trial to be fair this film however do not seem to think so besides that there several gape hole in the plot use for convenience for example there be an unknown character call Mickey Mouse who be a member of the Klan and for reason unknown be help the member of the defense team escape from serious danger of the other member of the Klan after Bullock be kidnap by Sutherland and company and leave for dead in the wilderness this unknown person come and save herand -PRON- never find out who -PRON- be and why -PRON- be help out the people -PRON- should be terrorizingbr br and speak of the Sutherland character 's reign of terror -PRON- be amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character be in stop -PRON- throughout the film there be a scene when Sutherland become a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and try to shoot Jake as -PRON- come out shoot one of the guard instead now -PRON- 'd think since there be dozen of police around -PRON- would be easy to surround and capture the sniper no such luck from what -PRON- could see no one seem to even care that a sniper be still on the loose even after Bullock be rescue by Mickey Mouse -PRON- never ever mention who -PRON- kidnapper be nor be -PRON- even question why be this Simple the Sutherland character be need throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically -PRON- should have be out of the picturebr br besides Bullock 's character there another thankless character -PRON- be Jake 's assistant play by Oliver Platt there seem to be one reason for -PRON- character to be in the movieto supply a number of oneliner for the audience in -PRON- opinion oneliner show a major weakness in serious film when use -PRON- demonstrate that the filmmaker be not confident that the story and dialogue alone be enough to keep the audience 's attention and so use -PRON- to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that -PRON- be watch an entertain filmbr br but enough of the film 's many minor problem what about the film 's message here -PRON- be clear that Carl be indeed guilty of murder -PRON- see how -PRON- plan for hour to murder the man who rape -PRON- daughter the lawyer argue that -PRON- be temporary insanity etc that cause -PRON- to kill in desperation Jake ask the jury to close -PRON- eye as -PRON- recount the rape in detail as part of -PRON- closing arguement after describe everything that take place -PRON- add on one final linethe girl be white -PRON- then see member of the jury with tear in -PRON- eyesbr br in the very next scene a girl come out yell -PRON- be free -PRON- be free wait a minute do jury base -PRON- verdict on -PRON- emotion or on the fact Most of all why be not there any scene that show the jury deliberate and what -PRON- be really think after -PRON- emotion wear off -PRON- will tell -PRON- why -PRON- could not show the delibertion because no JURY could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the defense 's closing arguement touch -PRON- heart what be the message that someone be justify in kill if -PRON- be a form of revenge for a previous crime do to thembr br this film should have have the courage to say that murder be not ok in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal but since dollar be at stake the filmmaker be more concerned about spare the audience ' feeling than -PRON- be about present a responsible message if people start kill as a form of revenge the maker of this film should be hold responsible what a socially irresponsible film this be
0,ok here be the deal -PRON- love action movie and generally have no problem suspend a great deal of disbelief over plot hole or other implausible action however this movie go far beyond minor flaw and go straight to the ridiculous let -PRON- get this straight the police send a notorious gangster and cop killer along with a number of other prisoner on a bus with a grand total of two guard -PRON- then be force to stop at a precinct where precisely two cop be work one of which be a day away from retirement and the other be a burn out apparently the building be about to be shut down so somehow the police decide that everyone else in the entire precinct get the night off for new year 's eve right but wait -PRON- get well Gabriel Byrne show up to take out Fishburne before -PRON- can rat -PRON- and other dirty cop out although -PRON- never find out anything about -PRON- relationship or dealing interestingly the cop launch the assault on the precinct be in full SWAT gear with night vision goggle assault rifle the whole nine yard later on -PRON- even bring in a helicopter with MORE people in full gear -PRON- be not a cop but -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- can not just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone ask what -PRON- be do and the police helicopter in the supposedly terrible winter storm also no one near the precinct happen to hear or see this major siege go on with flash grenade and heavy rifle fire go off -PRON- mean seriously come on -PRON- know this be set in Detroit but even there -PRON- would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission -PRON- also love the fact that -PRON- find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still work and have bullet that be still intact and usablebr br -PRON- could live with some of these problem if there be not other glaring issue also for one the open couple minute of the movie be shoot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and -PRON- think be go to set the tone for the rest of the movie unfortunately -PRON- be wrong the remainder of the film have no sense of pacing or tension or drama the character do not relate to each other in any way which be probably largely due to the fact that -PRON- be not particularly interesting there be not enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there be not enough character developmentstorytelling to make this a passable thrillerdrama the relationship between HawkeFishburn be the only thing that the director even try to make interesting or intense oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness uh -PRON- think this be in the middle of a run down industrial section of Detroit and suddenly -PRON- be in the wood the acting be not terrible in this movie -PRON- be just that the directing and writing be atrocious -PRON- really enjoy some of Hawkes Fishburne Byrne Dennehy 's other movie but this one be terrible

0,although -PRON- plot be take from the history of ancient Rome ' Caligula ' be not make in the style of swordandsandal epic like ' Spartacus ' or ' Gladiator ' that style of moviemaking be out of favour in the late seventy rather -PRON- more closely resemble a cross between a softcore porn movie and a video nasty at least the shorten 150 minute version do -PRON- have never see the full 210 minute version but to judge from the description of -PRON- on this page -PRON- would seem close to a cross between a hardcore porn movie and a video nasty br br as one would expect from a film produce by the publisher of ' Penthouse ' there be much naked flesh to be see and the film lovingly catalogue Caligula 's sexual perversion include -PRON- incestuous affair with -PRON- sister Drusilla what be perhaps unexpected from the publisher of a magazine so closely associate with the heterosexual male lifestyle be that there be as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly homoerotic overtone to many scene the obsession with sex be balance by an equal obsession with violence as though Bob Guccione Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass be try to kill two taboo with one stone -PRON- be a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a brazen film should be call ' Brass ' and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be call ' Gore ' character be put to death or mutilate in a variety of sadistic way and there be a charming scene of homosexual rape br br the Emperor Caligula and -PRON- predecessor Tiberius be certainly know for -PRON- debauched lifestyle so the film 's concentration on sex and violence be not necessarily historically inaccurate -PRON- do however question whether such a concentration be necessary to help -PRON- understand this period in roman history both ' the Fall of the Roman Empire ' and ' Gladiator ' be set during the reign of Commodus an Emperor quite as cruel and licentious as Caligula in neither case do the filmmaker find -PRON- necessary to turn -PRON- film into a mixture of ' up Pompeii ' ' Emmanuelle ' and ' the Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' and both those film be artistically far well than ' Caligula'br br the acting in the film be not particularly bad with a few exception such as the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla Malcolm McDowell make a suitably insane Caligula suitable that be in the context of this film the real Caligula be doubtless both cruel and eccentric but historian have debate whether -PRON- be actually mentally ill the great mystery be exactly why so many distinguished british actor should have agree to take part in such a trashy production in the case of Helen Mirren the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star -PRON- be probably connect to -PRON- rather regrettable tendency to alternate between the highbrow and the sleazy but heaven alone know what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud think -PRON- be do unlike some other famous stage actor such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton Gielgud do not always look completely at home in the cinema but here -PRON- give a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva a decent and honourable Senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity be as out of place as a pearl on a dunghill br br Guccione clearly succeed in -PRON- ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence whether Brass and Vidal have quite the same ambition for the film be open to question the film do not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politic of dictatorship even see as erotica -PRON- be secondrate 410
